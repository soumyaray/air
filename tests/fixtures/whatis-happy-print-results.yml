In case of different lengths, the shorter vector will be recycled to match the length of the longer vector.\n\n**Simple example with output:**\n\n```r\nvector1 <- c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\nvector2 <- c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\")\nresult <- paste0(vector1, vector2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[1] \"apple1\"   \"banana2\"  \"cherry3\"\n```\n\nIn this example, each fruit name from `vector1` is combined with the corresponding number from `vector2`, resulting in a new vector with combined strings."
